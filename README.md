# Curriculum Vitae

Curriculum Vitae with [gatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) a static page generator for [reactJs](https://reactjs.org/).

Im currently working on a new Version of my CV which is more optimized for PDF.

It uses MUI instead of Bootstraps and MDX instead of JSON files

Check it out: [gatsby-mui-cv](https://github.com/firsttris/gatsby-mui-cv)

## Motivation

- Most recruiters request a CV in Word to convert it in their layout. Often they even tweak the history in your CV in the hope's to win the project. that's why i decited to create an HTML CV which cannot be changed.

- With a CV coded Javascript you could already show some of your skills by providing the CV.

- It's easier to always have the exact same styling / format and just change the data.

- I wanted to have a multi-language CV.

## Template, Author & License

Instead of creating my own design, which would probably not so awesome, i decided to search on Github if someone already had a similar idea which i could fork and integrate with GatsbyJs.

This is what i used as source:
